# Candi Rank

## Goal

Create a react application that allows a user to save comments on the video responses of job applicants.

## How to Run

>npm install
>npm start
>npm test

## Technologies Used

* React 
* Enzyme / Jest
* json-server

## If I had more time
I would implement a backend service, that would query a trained model such as 'good applicant' and train by allowing the user to thumbs up or thumbs down; think FaceMash for the job market
